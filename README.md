# xlFrame
A free VBA library to make structural analysis easy in Microsoft Excel.

## Introduction
This project gives you the ability to perform 2D structural analysis on frame, truss, and beam structures using Visual Basic for Applications within Microsoft Excel. xlFrame uses the direct stiffness method to analyze structures.

xlFrame was designed by a practicing licensed structural engineer (SE) with over 10 years of design experience. It was designed to meet the demand of real world structural analysis problems. It allows for quick development of structural engineering spreadsheets that solve indeterminate structures. xlFrame calculates reactions, member forces at any given point, max/min member forces, shear/moment/axial load diagrams, joint deflections, and member deflections.

## Help Wanted
If you are capable and interested in making a contribution, I am looking for more contributors to join this project. It has taken years to learn how to bring it to this point, and I am open-sourcing it to get help with maintaining and improving it going forward.
